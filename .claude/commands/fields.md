Use the `get_list_custom_fields` tool to discover all custom fields available on the list.

Display the results in a clean format showing:
- Field name
- Field type (text, number, dropdown, etc.)
- Field ID (for use with set_custom_field)
- For dropdowns: all available options with their IDs

This is useful for understanding what metadata can be set on tasks.
